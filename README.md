This is a gun for playing Russian Roulette that the detective can buy.

Every time the barrel is spun (equipping or secondary fire) the gun picks between 1 and 6. If the player press primary fire they say a voice line then pull the trigger. If it is a 6 then they die, anything else it doesn't fire and instead advances the number by 1. The number is printed in the server log if you are interested in how close you came to death :)

There are also two other Russian Roulette guns that the traitors can buy, one that always misses and one that always fires. They go in the secondary equipment slot so that a traitor can pick up the normal one the detective can buy and throw out their fake one.

Model and sound effects are from No More Room In Hell which is a 100% free game on Steam! https://store.steampowered.com/app/224260/No_More_Room_in_Hell/
